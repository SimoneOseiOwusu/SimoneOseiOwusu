## Hi there 👋

# Simone Osei Owusu

I build (and learn by building) Python tools for energy-system modelling and reproducible analysis, with a focus on the **intersection of economics and stranded-asset risk across the electricity supply chain**.

- 📚 FFRM documentation (Read the Docs): https://ffrm-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- ✅ Merged PR: Integrated the HiGHS solver into FFRM: https://github.com/FossilFuelRetirementModel/ffrm_python/pull/1

## What I work on
🔭 **Economics of stranded assets** across the electricity supply chain (generation → transmission → distribution → finance)
- Energy/electricity system modelling (e.g., OSeMOSYS as a user / Pyomo-based workflows)
- Scenario analysis, data engineering, and reproducible workflows
- Stranded asset / power sector retirement analysis

## Featured work

### Fossil Fuel Retirement Model (FFRM)
- Built and maintained the documentation site (installation, run options, examples, changelog):  
  https://ffrm-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- Added support for the **HiGHS** solver via Pyomo/APPSI and exposed it in the CLI (`--solver highs`) (merged PR):  
  https://github.com/FossilFuelRetirementModel/ffrm_python/pull/1

## Experience with OSeMOSYS Global
I’ve used OSeMOSYS Global for modelling and analysis, but I haven’t contributed code to the project.

## Skills I’m building
- 🌱 Python: clean code, debugging, structuring projects, packaging basics
- 🌱 Quality: unit tests (pytest), linting/formatting (ruff/black), simple CI
- 🌱 Data work: pandas, Excel/CSV pipelines
