Hi there 👋🏽  
⚡ I work on the economics of stranded assets across the electricity supply chain  
🐍 I’m learning Python by building energy-system modelling + reproducible analysis tools  
📚 I built the FFRM docs: https://ffrm-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/  
✅ I merged HiGHS solver support into FFRM: https://github.com/FossilFuelRetirementModel/ffrm_python/pull/1
